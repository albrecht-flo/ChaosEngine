# ChaosEngine

This is a small game engine I write to learn about different techniques, frameworks, apis etc. with regards to computer
games and realtime processing.

## About

This is the repository where I will document my journey learning the Vulkan API by creating a rendering engine.

## Vulkan Resources

These are the sources I used the most

- [Vulkan documentation](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/1.2.131.1/windows/getting_started.html)
- [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com)
- [Sascha Willems Vulkan examples](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/)
- [GPU Open](https://gpuopen.com/page/2/?s=Vulkan)

## Art ressources

### Sandbox
- Awesome 2D art by [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/)  -- License: CC0 1.0 Universal

### Sound test
- `background.ogg` -- shortened version of "Woodland Fantasy" by Matthew Pablo from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/woodland-fantasy) -- License: CC-BY 3.0
- `steps.ogg` -- created using samples by TinyWorlds from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/different-steps-on-wood-stone-leaves-gravel-and-mud) -- License: CC0
## License

This project is published under the Apache 2 license in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.
**BUT** the projects that this application depends on (`dep/`) have their own licenses,
which need to be considered when building the project and publishing any created artifacts.

I try to only rely on opensource projects but some of them have more restrictive licenses than this code itself.

## Features
